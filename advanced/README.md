To create this project, coders will use bootstrap to layout their page and gh-pages to host their portfolio. |
| [**2: Rock, Paper, Scissors**](units/unit2) | 3 | jQuery, Arrays, Math Library, Conditionals|In this unit, coders will create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The Rock, Paper, Scissors game will take user choice, generate a computer choice, and display the winner to the screen. To create this project, coders will use jQuery to take user input and display data, arrays to store user choice, the Math Library to generate a random index, and conditionals determine the winner.|
| [**3: Pig Latinizer**](units/unit3) | 3 | Functions, String Methods, Array Methods, For Loops| In this unit, coders will create a Pig Latinizer. The Pig Latinizer will take a user's sentence and display the sentence in pig latin on the screen. To create this project, coders will use jQuery to take user input and display data, functions to separate concerns, string methods to separate and transform words, for loops to iterate over multiple items in an array, and array methods to add items and join items into a sentence.|
| [**4: Playlist**](units/unit4) | 3 | Objects, Iteration|In this unit, coders will create a Playlist. The Playlist will display a list of information about different songs with images and links to play the songs. To create this project, coders will create an array of songs objects, use a for loop to iterate over the array of object, and display data to the screen using jQuery. They will use .push to add new songs to their playlist.|
| [**5: Giphy App**](units/unit5) | 3 | API, GET, AJAX, JSON | In this unit, coders will create a Giphy App. The Giphy App will take a search term as an input and display a random Gif in a thumbnail on the screen.
